I'm killing the bspwm switch for the moment. I'm having odd issues with xrandr configuration for some reason and it's making it difficult to get correct multi-monitor setups. BSPWM seems like a really awesome WM and already I'm seeing some things I like better than i3, but for now i3 does 99% of what I need really well and it might be better to keep using my functional WM and learning tools to make WMs more functional on it rather than switching now.
