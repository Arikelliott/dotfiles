I'm switching my dotfiles over to NixOS and Home-manager so that I can manage them and sync them across devices more easily. I'm just tired of installing things on a new machine and having certain things get broken because I didn't realize it wasn't in my dotfiles repo.

I apologize ahead of time to any hypothetical people that might want to use my dotfiles but don't want to sort through Home-manager's weird structure to reconstitute them back into something a non-weird Linux distro can use.


Also, I have more dotfiles stored in the `archive1` branch, basically everything I've ever experimented with. My BSPWM config is probably the only one worth much though.
