if you want to go back to the original search result, you just have to switch to the \"root\" tab.\n    Moreover, each tree will reflect a group of tabs on a similar topic.\n\n\nPlease enjoy as you like!\n\nTips:\n\n    \"F1\" key toggles the TST sidebar.\n    \"Tree Style Tab\" toolbar button also toggles the sidebar. If it's unnecessary, you can remove it from the toolbar.\n\n\nExtensions extend TST:\n\nTST provides an API for other extensions.\nSome extend the behavior of TST's sidebar panel:\n\n    Multiple Tab Handler allows you to select multiple tabs with long-press on tabs. It also allows you to close mutiple tabs with long-press on the closebox on tabs.\n    TST Bookmarks Subpanel allows you to show a small \"Bookmarks\" sidebar panel below tabs in the TST's sidebar.\n    TST More Tree Commands provides more context menu and keyboard shortcut commands to manipulate TST's tree.\n    TST Active Tab in Collapsed Tree shows a small tab on a collapsed tree as an alias for the last active tab under the tree.\n    TST Active Tab on Scroll Bar shows a marker to indicate the position of the active tab, on the scrollbar.\n    TST Auto Group Tabs provides ability to group newly opened tabs automatically in various conditions.\n    TST Lock Tree Collapsed allows you to lock arbitrary trees as collapsed. (This was a built-in feature on TST 3.3.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Tab Drag Handle provides a small tooltip on tab labels to start dragging of tabs for specific operations. (This was a built-in feature on TST 2.6.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Indent Line provides indent lines like Visual Studio Code's one.\n    TST Open Bookmarks as Partial Tree allows you to open only some bookmarks in a folder as a partial tree. Moreover, it also provides ability to open tree of container tabs from bookmarks.\n    TST-MiddleClick allows you to run \"undo close tab\" or \"close currently active tab\" command on middle click on the sidebar.\n    Tree Style Tab Mouse Wheel allows you to switch active tab by wheel scrolling.\n    Tab flip for Tree Style Tab allows you to move focus to the tab previously focused, by clicking on the active tab.\n    Tree Style Tab Focus Preceding Tab on Close focuses the previous tab instead of the next tab when a tab is closed.\n    Tab Unloader for Tree Style Tab allows you to unload tabs by clicking on them in the sidebar.\n    Move unloaded tabs for Tree Style Tab allows you to move tabs in the sidebar without them becoming active.\n    Tree Style Tab in Separate Window allows you to open the Tree Style Tab sidebar page in a new window.\n    Auto Tab Discard supports the fake context menu in the Tree Style Tab sidebar.\n    UnloadTabs supports the fake context menu in the Tree Style Tab sidebar.\n    Bookmark Tree for Tree Style Tab allows you to bookmark and restore trees.\n    TST Hoverswitch allows you to switch tabs by hovering over them.\n    TST Colored Tabs gives custom background color for tabs based on their domain.\n    Add Last Active Class To Tab helps you to give custom appearance for the \"previously active tab\".\n    TSTのタブを閉じるボタンの挙動を変更 (tst-change-close-tab-button-be) allows you to close the parent and its all descendants with a middle click on the closebox of a parent tab, whether the tree is expanded or collapsed.\n    TST Select Random Tab adds a context menu option for selecting a random tab in a Tree Style Tab tree.\n    TST Tab Search provides a search field (as a subpanel) to filter opened tabs in the sidebar.\n\n\nLatest

The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.
